# Passion.Purpose.Progress
## This Repository is a Portfolio of my work

## User story

### As a Developer, I WANT to create and deploy a portfolio of work samples that is appealing to employers with the purpose of attracting opportunities for employment. 


## Acceptance Criteria

### provide samples of previous work/projects/challenges.

#### GIVEN I am still in the beginning of my bootcamp course, I provided the work from the first challenge
#### I put placeholders in the spaces where I will provide future work.

### Make sure to provide clearly visible self explanatory sections and links to easily access those areas of the page. 
### Example(name & photo, my work, and how to contact me)

#### Before I loaded my portfolio onto GITHUB I made sure to provide a visible name next to a recent photo, I added links to sections about ME, My Work, and how to contact ME.
#### I also provided links to my github, my email and my number incase anyone wanted to contact me.
#### WHEN presented with my first application
#### You'll notice the application's image is larger than the others
#### WHEN you click on the image of Horiseon
#### You get redirected to that deployed application
#### I toggled and played with the page in order to resize the view of the site on various screens and devices
#### to get a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
 

## As I advance my knowledge of this field in time this Portfolio will be Updated and Readjusted and Reconfigured.
